For the three months ended December 31, 2024, consolidated net income was $6,008,000 or $0.73 per diluted share (EPS), as compared to $7,324,000, or $0.89 EPS, for the prior quarter and $5,865,000, or $0.71 EPS for the same period a year ago. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2024, totaled $24,948,000, or $3.02 EPS, representing a decrease of 19.1% compared to $30,848,000, or $3.75 EPS for 2023. The decrease in QTD earnings compared to the prior quarter is related to loan recoveries which resulted in the reversal of credit loss provision of $1,620,000 recorded during the third quarter of 2024. The increase over the same period a year ago is related to a credit loss provision of $1,130,000 recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023, corresponding to macro-economic conditions and loan growth of $100.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. Despite the positive variance related to the reversal of credit loss provisions, 2024 YTD earnings decreased compared to 2023 due to an increase in deposit interest expense and general operating expenses.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>",
